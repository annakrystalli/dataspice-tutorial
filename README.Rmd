# dataspice-tutorial

The goal of dataspice-tutorial is a practical exercise in creating metadata for an example field collected data product using package `dataspice`. 

- Understand basic metadata and why it is important
- Understand where and how to store them
- Understand how they can feed into more complex metadata objects.

## `dataspice` 

Package [`dataspice`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/dataspice) makes it easier for researchers to create basic, lightweight and concise metadata files for their datasets. Metadata fields are based on [schema.org](http://schema.org/Dataset)

## Data source : NEON data portal

### *Woody plant vegetation structure*

 This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from in-situ measurements of live and standing dead woody individuals and shrub groups, from all terrestrial NEON sites with qualifying woody vegetation. The **exact measurements collected per individual depend on growth form**, and these measurements are focused on:  
 
- enabling biomass and productivity estimation,  
- estimation of shrub volume and biomass   
- calibration / validation of multiple NEON airborne remote-sensing data products. 

  In general, comparatively large individuals that are visible to remote-sensing instruments are mapped, tagged and measured, and other smaller individuals are tagged and measured but not mapped. Smaller individuals may be subsampled according to a nested subplot approach in order to standardize the per plot sampling effort.

Structure and mapping data are reported **per individual per plot**; sampling metadata, such as per growth form sampling area, are reported per plot. 

For additional details, see protocol:

### `dataspice` exercise data

The data are a trimmed subset of data downladed from the [**NEON data portal**](http://data.neonscience.org/browse-data) after filtering for:

- time periods between **`2015-06` - `2016-06`**

- locations within NEON Domain area **`D01: Northeast`**

Filter returned data from **2 sites** from **`2015-6`** to **`2015-11`**.
